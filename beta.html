    <h1>Welcome To MaxMclean015!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>MaxMclean015 is kinda like a blog. I use it to express myself and get better with html. Currently it's pretty bare bones but I hope to make it a fully functional website with multiple pages. I don't know what will come to this website but I think I might make it a document hosting site.</p>
